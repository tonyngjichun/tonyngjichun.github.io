  <h2>Now</h2>
  <p>
    I build and evaluate diffusion systems for ad creatives at Meta AI Research. I’m interested in controllable generation,
    scalable data curation, and evaluation frameworks that move beyond surface-level metrics.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m open to collaborations on generative media systems, privacy-preserving perception, and robust evaluation.
