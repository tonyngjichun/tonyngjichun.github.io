I'm Tony Ng, a 4-th year Ph.D. student at [MatchLab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/matchlab/), Imperial College London. My research interest is the complex problem of visual localization in computer vision, specifically tackling it with deep learning and geometry. I am supervised by Prof. [Krystian Mikolajczyk](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.mikolajczyk) and co-supervised by Dr. [Vassileios Balntas](http://vbalnt.github.io/).

Previously I have interned at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/) (now Reality Labs, Meta) and at Scape Technologies before they were [acquired by Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/08/scapebook/).
