### about my research
I'm 4-th year Ph.D. student at [MatchLab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/matchlab/), Imperial College London. I am supervised by Prof. [Krystian Mikolajczyk](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.mikolajczyk) and co-supervised by Dr. [Vassileios Balntas](http://vbalnt.github.io/).

My research interests are Computer Vision, Deep Learning and 3D Geometry, specifically in combining them to solve the problem of [Visual Localization](https://www.visuallocalization.net/) for applications in Augmented Reality. My work include studies on Image Retrieval, Camera Pose Regression, Keypoints Detection & Description. Recently, I have started looking into the problem of privacy & security in computer vision, as well as multi-modal learning using language models (specifically auto-regressive Transformers).
