### about my research
I'm 4-th year Ph.D. student at [MatchLab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/matchlab/), Imperial College London. I am supervised by Prof. [Krystian Mikolajczyk](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.mikolajczyk) and co-supervised by Dr. [Vassileios Balntas](http://vbalnt.github.io/).

My research interests are Computer Vision, Deep Learning and 3D Geometry, specifically in combining them to solve the problem of [Visual Localization](https://www.visuallocalization.net/) for applications in Augmented Reality. My work include studies on Image Retrieval, Camera Pose Regression, Keypoints Detection & Description. Recently, I have started looking into the problem of privacy in visual localization - a relative new and unexplored area of study in this field, which only makes tackling it even more enjoyable! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

### more about me
I was born and raised in Hong Kong. After finishing my high school diploma, I went to Lonodn and did my undergraduate and Master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering at Imperial College. Then, I moved to the [Deparment of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) and began my PhD endeavour under Prof. Mikolajczyk.

Previously I have interned at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/) (now Reality Labs, Meta) and at Scape Technologies before they were [acquired by Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/08/scapebook/).

In my spare time, I like to train at the gym and play Tennis. I am also a keen player Age of Empires II and Minecraft, both of which I enjoy playing especially with my friends :smiley:
